MQTT and FlatBuffers: A Lightweight Alternative to ROS Messages
In the world of robotics and distributed systems, efficient communication between components is crucial. Two popular technologies for facilitating this communication are MQTT and FlatBuffers. These technologies offer compelling advantages over traditional ROS (Robot Operating System) messages, particularly in terms of compatibility, overhead, and dependencies. Below, we explore why MQTT and FlatBuffers might be considered a better solution for certain applications compared to ROS messages.

1. Compatibility and Flexibility
One of the primary advantages of FlatBuffers is their inherent support for forward and backward compatibility. FlatBuffers allow you to add or remove fields from data structures without breaking existing code, making them an excellent choice for systems that need to evolve over time. This flexibility is achieved through a schema evolution mechanism that tolerates missing fields, allowing older versions of software to read messages from newer versions, and vice versa.

In contrast, ROS messages have a more rigid structure. Any change to a ROS message definition necessitates a rebuild of the entire system, which can lead to significant downtime and integration challenges. This lack of built-in compatibility can hinder the adaptability of systems that rely on ROS messages, especially in environments where updates and modifications are frequent.

2. Build Time and Development Overhead
FlatBuffers are designed to be lightweight and efficient. They require minimal setup and can be integrated into projects with a simple installation, without the need for complex build systems like CMake or compilers like GCC. This simplicity reduces the time and effort required to get up and running with FlatBuffers, making them an attractive option for developers who value quick iteration and deployment.

ROS, on the other hand, involves a more complex setup process. It relies heavily on CMake for building packages and managing dependencies, which can introduce significant overhead during the development process. This complexity can be a barrier for developers who need a streamlined and efficient workflow.

3. Dependency and File Size Efficiency
MQTT and FlatBuffers bring in less dependency overhead and result in smaller file sizes compared to ROS. MQTT, a lightweight publish-subscribe messaging protocol, is designed for constrained environments and high-latency networks. It requires minimal resources, making it ideal for use in IoT devices and systems with limited computational power.

FlatBuffers, similarly, are known for their low memory footprint and high-speed serialization capabilities. They generate smaller binary data compared to other serialization formats, which is crucial for systems with bandwidth constraints or those that need to transmit data quickly.

In contrast, ROS can introduce substantial dependency overhead due to its reliance on a broad ecosystem of packages and tools. This can lead to larger file sizes and increased resource consumption, which may not be feasible for all applications, particularly those running on resource-constrained hardware.

Conclusion
While ROS and its messaging system have been pivotal in advancing robotics research and applications, MQTT and FlatBuffers offer a lightweight and flexible alternative that can be more suitable for certain use cases. The forward and backward compatibility of FlatBuffers, combined with the reduced build and dependency overhead of both MQTT and FlatBuffers, make them an attractive choice for developers seeking efficiency and adaptability in their communication systems. These advantages position MQTT and FlatBuffers as compelling solutions for modern, distributed, and evolving systems.
